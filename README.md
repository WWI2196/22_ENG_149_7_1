Write a program that can be used to gather statistical data about the number of movies university students see in a month. The program should be able to calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of the data entered.

· First, ask the user how many students were surveyed.
· Dynamically allocate an array of that size.
· Then the program should allow the user to enter the number of movies each student has seen.
· Write four functions to calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. Use one function to calculate variance and standard deviation. All functions should use pointers for input parameters. Do not print anything to the console within the user-defined functions.
· Please save the source file as yy_ENG_xxx_7_1.cpp.
